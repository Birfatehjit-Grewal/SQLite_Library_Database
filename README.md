# LibraryDatabase
A Command line simulation of a simple Library Database System using SQLite

## Running the Application
Run `AppUI.py` using `python AppUI.py`to start the program, in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for ease of use.

The minimum requirement is Python 3.10 but I recommend downloading the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
