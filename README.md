Run _AppUI.py_ to start the program, in Anaconda for ease of use.

Make sure you are using Python 3.10 or later, as our project depends on some of those features.

We have also included a charge feature that charges for overdue books and allows users to pay off their charges.

You may also register a new user. Play around with the app.
